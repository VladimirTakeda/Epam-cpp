    1) I never use two mutexes in the scope of one class
    2) I am using a mutex, semaphores and other sync elements to protect only instance of my class
    3) According to the rule 2) all classes that contain NAMES sync element should live untill the end of process (we have to close them at the end of the programm)
    4) [optional] if i am using method of another class under my guard I am very possible doing deadlock
    5) I write comments only in English
    6) I use as little as possible numbers of sync elements
